The application allows to list the available products and quantities, and the articles in each product. The user is able to register a sale,
and the inventory is updated accordingly.

The API is very inreliable so there is error handling implemented. However it doesn't make user experience smooth. If I have more time I would make some fixes to make user experience smoother despites often errors occured in API. I would also improve the styling. So far there are only basics styles added but I believe the application can look much better.
